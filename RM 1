\title {\textbf{Heart Disease Prediction Using ML}}

\author{Ms.RAMA KENE}

\date {July 2024}

\maketitle

\tableofcontents

\chapter {Introduction}

\section{Background}

This project is all about heart disease prediction.

heart disease are major cause of mortality.

\section{Objective}

To create a prediction system for detecting heart disease.

\chapter{Literature review}

\section{Cardiovascular Disease and Risk Factor}

Cardiovascular diseases encompass a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, including coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure. Key risk factors

identified in the literature include age, gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and family history.

\section{Predictive Modeling in Cardiovascular Health}

Previous studies have explored the application of machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks in predicting heart disease.

\chapter {Methodology}

\section{Data Collection and Preprocessing}

The dataset used in this study consists of anonymized patient data sourced from Kaggle. Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables

\section {Feature Selection}

Feature selection techniques such as correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) are employed to identify the most relevant predictors for heart disease prediction.

\chapter{Results}

\section{Performance metrics}

The performance of each model is evaluated and compared based on the aforementioned metrics.

subsection {Overall Performance}

The performance of each model is evaluated and compared based on the aforementioned metrics.

\chapter{Conclusion}

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the feasibility and efficacy of machine learning in predicting heart disease risk based on patient data. The developed models offer valuable

insights for healthcare providers to implement preventive strategies and improve patient outcomes in cardiovascular health.

Q.1)
         
(B) Creating an equation, writing multiple equations, Aligning multiple equations
    , creating matrices in Latex, label command, Cross referencing with ref command.

Code:

\documentclass[12pt] {article}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{document}
\section{Equations and Numbering Equations}

\subsection{Creating an equation}
\begin{equation}
a^2+b^2=c^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Writing multiple equations}
\begin{equation}
(a+b)^2=a^2+2ab+b^2
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(a-b)^2=a^2-2ab+b^2
\end{equation}

\subsection {Aligning multiple equations}
\begin{align}
sin^2\theta+cos^2\theta=1\\
1+tan^2\theta sec^2\theta\\
tan\theta=\frac{sin\theta} {cos\theta}
\end{align}

\subsection{Creating matrices}
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6\\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}

\]

\subsection{Cross Referencing with label and ref command}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:speed}
s=\frac{d} {t} 
\end{equation}

As we see in Equation \ref{eq:speed}, speed equals to distance covered per unit time
